# An icon to be displayed in the dialog box. If the control is created as part of a dialog box, the text is the name of an icon (not a filename) defined elsewhere in the resource file.

# The icon can be an animated cursor.
# The style ignores the CreateWindow parameters nWidth and nHeight; the control automatically sizes itself to accommodate the icon. As it uses the LoadIcon function, the SS_ICON style can load only icons of dimensions SM_CXICON and SM_CYICON. This restriction can be bypassed by using the SS_REALSIZEIMAGE style in addition to SS_ICON.

# SS_REALSIZEIMAGE uses LoadImage, overriding the process normally followed under SS_ICON. It does not load cursors; if LoadImage fails, no further attempts to load are made. It uses the actual resource width. The static control is resized accordingly, but the icon remains aligned to the originally specified left and top edges of the control.

# Adjusts the bitmap to fit the size of the static control. For example, changing the locale can change the system font, and thus controls might be resized. If a static control had a bitmap, the bitmap would no longer fit the control. This style bit dictates automatic redimensioning of bitmaps to fit their controls.
# If SS_CENTERIMAGE is specified, the bitmap or icon is centered (and clipped if needed). If SS_CENTERIMAGE is not specified, the bitmap or icon is stretched or shrunk.
